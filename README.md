# Tic-Tac-Toe
A 2-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the command line.

## Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a 2-player command line version of the age-old game. There are separate classes for Player and Game. As you play, the command line will show the state of play on the "board" (a 2D array). Players can win by populating a row, column, or diagonal with their letter. If all squares are filled but there is no winner, the game ends.

This game was designed using The Odin Project's Tic-Tac-Toe project guidelines (linked below). I practiced building a class, modularizing functions, basic system design, and exception handling.

## Technologies
* Ruby

## Issues & ideas
* Add a UI
* Refactor winning methods for better code reuse

## Instructions
If you have Ruby installed, you can download the Game.rb file and run the game from the command line using `ruby Game.rb`.
